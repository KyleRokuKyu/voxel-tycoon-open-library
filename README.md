## Getting Started

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Using the library

__**TODO: Fill in how to use the library after our first deployment.**__

### Contributing Prerequisites

This game has been written in C# as a mod for Voxel Tycoon (made in Unity),
therefore, we expect every contributor to have C# and Voxel Tycoon installed on
their device before they can continue.

#### Code Editor

In order to contribute to this repository, you will need an editor which
supports writing code in C#. A couple of commonly used
[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)s are:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Jet Brains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

However, for this project we will be using *Visual Studio (Community 2019)*
as proposed by the [Voxel Tycoon Tutorial](https://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/script-mods/creating-your-first-script-mod/).
Using a newer version won't give problems when writing code, however, it might
give problems when you try to help someone out in another version or editor.

In the installer, you will be asked to specify workloads. These are extra
components to help enhance development in a variety of different branches.
For this project you should select *.NET desktop development*. Within the
list of workloads there is also an option for *Game Development with Unity*,
however, we will not pick this one, since we will be using the Unity code
provided with the Voxel Tycoon installation.

After you select this component, then you can continue following the installer
and you will be done with the Visual Studio environment installation.

#### Voxel Tycoon (recommended)

Since this library is made as a mod for [Voxel Tycoon](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/),
we do expect all contributors to have a copy of the game which they can use for
testing purposes. If you do not own the game then you can buy it on Steam at:

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/732050/Voxel_Tycoon/">

	</td>
	<td>
		Voxel Tycoon ‚Äî a management sim set in the infinite voxel world.
		Mine resources and process them into goods on your custom factories.
		Set up supply chains and passenger routes with a huge fleet of trains,
		trucks, and buses, and turn small towns into prosperous megacities with
		a thriving economy!
	</td>
</tr> </table>
</a>

#### GitHub Desktop (advised)

Since you are reading this you most likely have a GitHub account already.
So to help with uploading your changes we advise to make use of
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a Git GUI made by GitHub.

### Installation

Once you have downloaded all the environments and required software, then you
can install the project. To do this you can either use the git console or use
the GitHub Desktop app. For the console approach you can follow the
[provided tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
With GitHub desktop it is as easy as clicking in the top left **file** and then
**clone repository**. In this menu you can now see all the repositories which
you have access to on GitHub, from here you can select the
**Voxel Tycoon Open Library** repository and download it.

For Visual Studio all you need to do is double click the
**Voxel Tycoon Open Library.sln** solution inside your downloaded folder).

After this you can use GitHub Desktop or your favourite Git system to commit
new changes which you'VE made to your feature specific branch on GitHub.

## Running Tests

__**TODO: Fill in testing chapter when we have a testing library.**__

### Unit Tests

### Integration Tests

### Mutation Tests

## Deployment

__**TODO: Fill in deployment when we have the CD active.**__

## Built with

This project would not have been possible without the following frameworks,
public packages and awesome people.

- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) - The main programming
  language used to write this library in.
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) - The engine which allows for quick game
  development.
- [Voxel Tycoon](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/) - The wonderful game which inspired
  us to start developing this project.
